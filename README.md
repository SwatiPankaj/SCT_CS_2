This is my skillcraft technology internship, second task: Image Encryption
Image encryption is the process of converting an image into an unrecognizable or scrambled form to protect it from unauthorized access. This is done using cryptographic techniques to ensure that the image's content can only be viewed by someone with the correct decryption key. Image encryption is commonly used in fields like secure image storage, transmission over insecure networks, and privacy protection.
